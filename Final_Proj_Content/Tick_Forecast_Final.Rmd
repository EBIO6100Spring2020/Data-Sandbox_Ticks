# Tick and *Borrelia* Background

Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S. and has been the subject of intense research for the last several decades. The disease is caused by a bacterial spirochete (*Borrelia* species) that is vectored by ticks (primarily *Ixodes scapularis*) Dozens of studies have addressed local- and landscape-scale factors that drive the dynamics of this system, with mixed success. Here, we aimed to use National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) data to tease apart the factors important to spatiotemporal variability in (i) tick abundance and (ii) *Borrelia* prevalence, which together determine human Lyme risk.

## Ecology of *Ixodes scapularis* & *Borrelia*

### *I. scapularis*
*I. scapularis* primary inhabits the eastern U.S. and has a ~2 year life cycle. **Eggs** are laid in spring of year *t* and hatch into **larvae** in summer of the same year. Larvae take a single bloodmeal (typically from a small mammal) in summer of year *t* and overwinter. Larvae then molt into **nymphs** in the late spring/early summer of year *t*+1. Nymphal ticks take a single bloodmeal in late spring/summer (typically from a small mammal, but also birds and reptiles). In autumn of year *t*+1, nymphs molt into **adults**. In late autumn/early winter of year *t*+1, adult ticks find an appropriate large mammal host (often deer) where the female takes a bloodmeal and sexual reproduction occurs. Eggs are laid the following spring, and the cycle repeats.

Numerous aspects of the abiotic environment can control *I. scapularis* distribution and abundance, including temperature and humidity which jointly drive the risk of dessication. Yet, broad population patterns of *I. scapularis* most closely correlate with the distribution of forests because the most important hosts for both larvae/nymphs and adults (white-footed mice and deer, respectively) rely heavily on forested habitats. Within forested areas, temporal variability may be introduced by processes driving changes in host populations, most notably acorn masting patterns. There are thus temporal and spatial considerations *I. scapularis* presence and abundance.

### *Borrelia*
*Borrelia* is vectored by ticks, with numerous reservoirs (though, most often small rodents). Tick eggs are virtually Borrelia-free---in other words the bacteria is not vertically transmitted. Tick larvae and nymphs may become infected with *Borrelia* when taking bloodmeals from infected reservoirs. Adult hosts (e.g., deer) tend not to be reservoirs for *Borrelia*, and thus host--parasite dynamics in this system are limited primarily to interactions involving larval or nymphal ticks and reservoir hosts. 

Because larvae are never infected prior to their bloodmeal (and only take 1 bloodmeal), they cannot transmit *Borrelia* to hosts and thus pose little threat to humans. Conversely, if larvae become infected during their bloodmeal, successfully molt into a nymph, and take a bloodmeal from a susceptible host they can transmit the infection. Owing to this and their small size (~1 mm) nyphal ticks pose the largest threat to human health via transmission of *Borrelia*. Infected adult ticks may also transmit *Borrelia* to humans but are conspicuous and more easily removed.

For these reasons, the density of infected nymphs (D.O.N.) of *I. scapularis* is the most common and successful index of Lyme risk. Understanding what drives D.O.N. requires understanding what drives both nymphal density *and* nymphal infection prevalence.

We limited all analyses to *I. scapularis* nymphs, which are the primary vector of human Lyme and for which there were plentiful NEON data. Formal analyses (W.E.M.) used tick *density*, in which raw tick counts were scaled by drag length, but because drag lenghts were fairly consistent across space/time (see plot directly below) and because raw counts are easier to intepret than densities, the former is displayed in exploratory maps/plots below.

## Survey Effort
```{r, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot() +
   geom_line(data=tickAbund %>% filter(!is.na(rawCount)) %>%
                group_by(siteID, month) %>%
                summarise(meanMonthAbund = mean(totalSampledArea), fmonth=first(month)) %>%
                ungroup(), 
             aes(x=fmonth, y=meanMonthAbund, colour=siteID),
             size=1) +
   theme_tick() +
   theme(legend.position = "none") +
   labs(x="Month",y="Mean Drag Length") +
   ggtitle("Survey effort across months",
           subtitle = "Colour denotes site")  +
   scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2,4,6,8,10,12))
```

## Spatial variation in ticks

A good starting place is to consider which NEON sites across the U.S. even have *I. scapularis* by plotting mean count per survey.
```{r, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot() +
   geom_map(map=north_america, data=north_america,
            aes(long, lat, map_id=region),
            colour="black", fill="gray80", size=.3) +
   ylim(c(25, 50)) +
   xlim(c(-125, -65)) +
   geom_point(data = tickAbund %>% filter(!is.na(rawCount)) %>%
                 group_by(siteID) %>%
                 summarise(meanAbund = mean(rawCount), lat=first(decimalLatitude), lon=first(decimalLongitude)) %>% 
                 ungroup(), 
              aes(x = lon, y = lat, fill = meanAbund),
              alpha = 0.8, size = 4, colour = "grey30",
              shape = 21) +
   scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", direction = -1, begin = 0.2)+
   theme_tick()+
   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust =0.5), axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank(),
         legend.position = "none")+
   xlab("")+
   ylab("")+
   ggtitle("Mean I. scapularis Count by Site")
```
We can see that, largely, *I. scapularis* is restricted to east of the Mississippi River.


Zooming in on the eastern half of the country, we can also see enormous plot-level variability in tick count per survey.
```{r, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot() +
   geom_map(map=north_america, data=north_america,
            aes(long, lat, map_id=region),
            colour="black", fill="gray80", size=.3) +
   ylim(c(25, 50)) +
   xlim(c(-95, -65)) +
   geom_point(data = tickAbund %>% filter(!is.na(rawCount)) %>%
                 group_by(plotID) %>%
                 summarise(meanAbund = mean(rawCount), lat=first(decimalLatitude), lon=first(decimalLongitude)) %>%
                 ungroup(), 
              aes(x = jitter(lon, amount=.5), y = jitter(lat, amount=.5), fill = meanAbund),
              alpha = 0.8, size = 4, colour = "grey30",
              shape = 21) +
   scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", direction = -1, begin = 0.2)+
   theme_tick()+
   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust =0.5), axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank(),
         legend.position = "none")+
   xlab("")+
   ylab("")+
   ggtitle("Mean I. scapularis Count by \n Plot within Site (jittered)")
```


Can also view the distribution of count data across these scales. First, let's look at domain-level.
```{r, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data=tickAbund,
       aes(x=reorder(domainID, desc(rawCount)), y=rawCount)) +
   geom_flat_violin(position=position_nudge(x=0.2,y=0), alpha=0.8) +
   geom_point(aes(y=rawCount, color=domainID),
              position=position_jitter(width=0.15), size=1, alpha=0.1) +
   geom_boxplot(width=0.2, outlier.shape=NA, alpha=0.8) +
   labs(y="Tick Count", x="NEON Domain") +
   guides(fill=FALSE, color=FALSE) +
   scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,2500)) +
   coord_flip() +
   theme_tick() +
   ggtitle("By Domain")
```
We can see that there are relatively few domains with *I. scapularis* and that there are some surveys that yielded extremely high nymph counts (~2500).

If we next consider plots within domains, we can furher see that even where ticks are detected and sometimes abundant, most surveys still yield counts of 0.
```{r, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data=filter(tickAbund, domainMax>0),
       aes(x=domainSite, y=rawCount)) +
   geom_flat_violin(position=position_nudge(x=0.2,y=0), alpha=0.8) +
   geom_point(aes(y=rawCount, color=domainID),
              position=position_jitter(width=0.015, height=.01), 
              size=2, alpha=0.1) +
   geom_boxplot(width=0.2, outlier.shape=NA, alpha=0.8) +
   labs(y="Tick Count", x="NEON Site") +
   guides(fill=FALSE, color=FALSE) +
   scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,100)) +
   coord_flip() +
   theme_tick() +
   theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
         axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
   ggtitle("Site within Domain",
           subtitle = "Colour denotes domain")
```
Note the x-axis range is restricted here to easier view the distribution of counts.

The final scale of consideration is plots within sites, where we also see high levels of variation.
```{r, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data=filter(tickAbund, domainMax>0),
       aes(x=domainSitePlot, y=rawCount)) +
   geom_flat_violin(position=position_nudge(x=0.2,y=0), alpha=0.8) +
   geom_point(aes(y=rawCount, color=domainID),
              position=position_jitter(width=0.015, height=.01), 
              size=2, alpha=0.1) +
   geom_boxplot(width=0.2, outlier.shape=NA, alpha=0.8) +
   labs(y="Tick Count", x="NEON Plot") +
   guides(fill=FALSE, color=FALSE) +
   scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,100)) +
   coord_flip() +
   theme_tick() +
   theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
         axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
   ggtitle("Plot within Site within Domain",
           subtitle="Colour denotes domain")
```


Exercises like these lead to several decisions:
(i) exclude domains with no ticks
(ii) within-site variability makes the use of latitude & longitude somewhat meaningless


## Temporal variability
As mentioned above, there are strong seasonal patterns in tick abundance owing to life cycle dynamics.

Although some annual variation exists and should be accounted for, the most prominent feature of the data is the annual peak in *I. scapularis* nymphal abundance.
```{r, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot() +
   geom_line(data=tickAbund %>% filter(domainMax>0) %>%
                group_by(plotID, month) %>%
                summarise(meanMonthAbund = mean(rawCount), fmonth=first(month)) %>%
                ungroup(), 
             aes(x=fmonth, y=meanMonthAbund, colour=plotID),
             size=1) +
   theme_tick() +
   theme(legend.position = "none") +
   labs(x="Month", y="Mean Count") +
   ggtitle("I. scapularis Count by Month",
           subtitle = "Colour denotes plot") +
   scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2,4,6,8,10,12))
```
This pattern raises several important points:
(i) there is a pretty clear split between "tick season" and "non-tick season"
(ii) there is a unimodal hump-shaped peak in nymph populations within that "tick season"

Yet, we still see plot-level variability. One important consideration that ties back to spatial patterns is habitat. We can split this temporal plot out by different NLCD classes to see some important patterns.
```{r, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# WEM edited this to make run
ggplot(data=tickAbund %>% filter(domainMax>0) %>%
                group_by(nlcdClass, month, domainID) %>%
                summarise(meanMonthAbund = mean(rawCount), fmonth=first(month),
                          nlcd=first(nlcdClass), domain=first(domainID)) %>%
                ungroup()) +
   geom_line(aes(x=fmonth, y=meanMonthAbund, colour=domain),
             size=1) +
   facet_wrap(~reorder(nlcd, desc(meanMonthAbund)), drop = TRUE) +
   theme_tick() +
   theme(legend.position = "none") +
   labs(x="Month", y="Mean Count") +
   ggtitle("I. scapularis across NLCD classes",
           subtitle = "Colour denotes site") +
   scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2,4,6,8,10,12))
```
These results are cool and make a lot of sense! *I. scapularis* distribution is tightly linked to that of its forest-dwelling hosts. So in addition to broad, domain-scale distribution limits there are also very strong, local patterns of distribution and abundance.



# Tick Abundance Models

## Modeling approach
Our goal was to build a model that could be used to predict and understand tick abundances at NEON sites. We investigated several modeling approaches including state-space time series, variance partitioning, boosted regression trees, generalized linear mixed models, and generalized additive models. We ultimately proceeded with GAMs due to their ability to handle the non-linear, temporal element of our data and their flexibility in response variable. 

One major challenge to modeling tick abundances (specifically, the densities of Ixodes nymphs) was the extreme zero-inflation in our data (as explored above). To handle this, we used zero-inflated poisson models. These models have two parts, one to predict the probability of 0s (the zero inflation model), and one to predict the counts (poisson model). 

We explored several predictors for both the poisson and the zero inflation models. For the zero inflation model, the predictor variables we considered were: 

   * `nlcdClass`
   * `season` (a binary predictor; whether the sampling event was between May-September or not)
   * `plotID` (a random effect)

Therefore, these variables influenced whether there were ticks present or not (probability of tick count being a 0 or not).

For the poisson model (counts), the predictor variables we considered were:

   * `year-plotID` (the combination of year and plot, as a random effect)
   * `plotID`  (a random effect)
   * `dayofYear` (a smoothed term)
   * `year` (a random effect)

Finally, we accounted for sampling effort by including the area of the tick drag as an offset.


## Read in the data

We fit our models using a training dataset that had one tick season removed from it (May through July, 2018; later used as the validation dataset). This dataset is similar to the one used in data exploration, but has a few columns added and scaled. Note that the domains with no ticks present were removed, but this dataset does contain plots that never had ticks.

```{r}
abun <- readRDS("data/nymph_abun_train.Rdata")
```

## Fit the models

Models are fit using the `mgcv` package. We used AIC for model selection. 

Code for fitting models is below. Note that if you run the code below verbatim, it will read in the list of model objects instead of actually fitting all the models, since model fitting is time intensive.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# check if models have already been run
models.exist <- file.exists("model_objects/zipmodels_tick_abun.Rdata")
# if so, read them in and can skip the next part
if(models.exist==TRUE){
  readRDS("Model_objects/zipmodels_tick_abun.Rdata") -> zipmodlist
  list2env(zipmodlist, .GlobalEnv)
  rm(zipmodlist)
}

# if the models haven't been pulled/run this will run them
# careful as this may take a while
if(models.exist == FALSE){
  abun <- readRDS("data_derived/nymph_abun_all.Rdata")
  head(abun)
  # fit zero-inflated Poissons
  # first part of the model: poisson process (abundance)
  # second part of the model: zero inflation process (prob of 0)
  # a null model
  zip0 <- gam(list(estimatedCount ~ offset(logSampledArea),
                   ~1),
              data = abun, family = ziplss())
  
  # random effects only
  zip1 <- gam(list(estimatedCount ~ s(plotID, bs = "re") + offset(logSampledArea) ,
                   ~s(plotID, bs = "re")),
              data = abun, family = ziplss())
  
  # add in season as a predictor of presence
  zip2 <- gam(list(estimatedCount ~ s(plotID, bs = "re") + offset(logSampledArea) ,
                   ~ season + s(plotID, bs = "re")),
              data = abun, family = ziplss())
  
  # add in nlcd as a predictor of presence
  zip3 <- gam(list(estimatedCount ~s(plotID, bs = "re") + offset(logSampledArea) ,
                   ~ season + nlcdClass + s(plotID, bs = "re")),
              data = abun, family = ziplss())
  
  # add in day of year as a predictor of abundance
  zip4 <- gam(list(estimatedCount ~ s(sDayofYear) + s(plotID, bs = "re") + offset(logSampledArea),
                   ~season + nlcdClass + s(plotID, bs = "re")),
              data = abun, family = ziplss())
  
  # add year as a random effect 
  zip5 <- gam(list(estimatedCount ~ s(sDayofYear) + s(fYear, bs = "re") + s(plotID, bs = "re") + offset(logSampledArea) ,
                   ~season + nlcdClass + s(plotID, bs = "re")),
              data = abun, family = ziplss())
  
  # add year as a random effect NESTED witin plot 
  zip6 <- gam(list(estimatedCount ~ s(sDayofYear) +offset(logSampledArea) + s(yearPlot, bs = "re"),
                   ~season + nlcdClass + s(plotID, bs = "re")),
              data = abun, family = ziplss())
  # add a randomn smooth for day of year by plot
  zip7 <- gam(list(estimatedCount ~ s(sDayofYear, plotID, bs = "re") +fYear + offset(logSampledArea) ,
                   ~season + nlcdClass + s(plotID, bs = "re")),
              data = abun, family = ziplss())
  zip8 <- gam(list(estimatedCount ~ s(sDayofYear, yearPlot, bs = "re") + offset(logSampledArea), 
                   ~season + nlcdClass + s(plotID, bs = "re")), 
              data = abun, family = ziplss())
  pattern <- ls(pattern="zip") # get names of models
  # pattern <- grep("zip", names(.GlobalEnv), value = TRUE)
  models <- do.call("list", mget(pattern))
  
  # save models
  saveRDS(models, "Model_objects/zipmodels_tick_abun.Rdata" )
}
```

Compare models with AIC:
```{r}
pattern <- ls(pattern="zip") # get names of models
zipmodlist <- do.call("list", mget(pattern)) # make a list of all them
do.call(rbind, lapply(zipmodlist, glance)) %>% data.frame() %>%
  mutate(model = pattern) %>% select(model, everything(.)) %>% arrange(AIC)
```

Explore output from "best" model:

```{r}
summary(zip6)
```

## Optional: re-fit best model with brms
In order to better extract uncertainty estimates, we can fit the best model in `brms` which will give posterior distributions of parameters. 

Note that if you want to run this model you will have to manually change the code below; otherwise, it reads in an existing model object. 
```{r, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
run.mod <- "no" # change this if you want to run the model 
# warning that running it takes a long time (e.g. hours)!
if(run.mod == "yes"){
  require(brms)
  b_zip6 <- brm(bf(
    estimatedCount ~  s(sDayofYear)+ (1|yearPlot) + offset(logSampledArea), # observation-level RE
    zi ~ nlcdClass + season + (1|plotID)),
    data = abun, family = zero_inflated_poisson(), iter =1000, chains = 4)
  b_zip7 <- update(b_zip6, iter = 2000) # run chains longer
  saveRDS(b_zip7, "Model_objects/b_zip7.Rdata")
}

# if you don't want to run it can just load it
b_zip7 <- readRDS("model_objects/b_zip7.Rdata")
summary(b_zip7)
plot(b_zip7, ask = FALSE, newpage = FALSE)
```

This model didn't converge; the chains look pretty bad. In the future, we could use stronger priors and explore correlation among parameters which might be leading to the issue. For now, we will just proceed with maximum likelihood models fit with `mgcv`. 

## Evaluate model fit using validation dataset

The test/validation dataset is similar to the training, except contains a few months of data that were left out (May - July 2018). 

```{r}
nymphtest <- readRDS("data/nymph_abun_test.Rdata")
```

We will predict tick abundances using our model and compare to the actual abundances.

From our two-part model, we can predict a few different responses. (1) probability of presence, from the zero-inflated (logit) part of the model (2) tick count if they are present from the poisson part of the model and (3) mean expected count, which multiplies the two together (type = "response").

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
nymph_pred <- nymphtest 

# get predicted mean count (3)
nymph_pred <- cbind(nymph_pred, data.frame(predict(zip6, newdata = nymph_pred, type = "response", se.fit = TRUE)) %>%
                       select(pred_mean_count = fit, pred_mean_count_se = se.fit))
# i'm skeptical of the standard error here...


# also get predicted probability
nymph_pred <- cbind(nymph_pred, data.frame(predict(zip6, newdata = nymph_pred, se.fit = TRUE)) %>%  # predict 
   mutate(pred_prob = plogis(fit.2), pred_prob_low = plogis(fit.2-2*se.fit.2), pred_prob_hi = plogis(fit.2 + 2*se.fit.2), # back transform
          pred_pois_count = exp(fit.1), pred_pois_count_low = exp(fit.1 - 2*se.fit.1), pred_pois_count_hi = exp(fit.1 + 2*se.fit.1)) %>%
   select(pred_prob, pred_prob_low, pred_prob_hi, pred_pois_count, pred_pois_count_low, pred_pois_count_hi))
```

### How well does the model do at probability of presence?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
nymph_pred %>% ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(pred_prob, fill = as.factor(nymph_presence))) + facet_wrap(~nymph_presence) + theme_classic() +
  xlab("Model predicted probability of presence") +
  labs(fill = "Observed Tick Presence")
```

Were there plots where model predicts very low prob of ticks but they were observed?
```{r}
(nymph_pred %>% filter(nymph_presence==1, pred_prob  < 0.05) %>% nrow())/(nymph_pred %>% filter(pred_prob  < 0.05) %>% nrow())

(nymph_pred %>% filter(nymph_presence==1, pred_prob  < 0.1) %>% nrow())/(nymph_pred %>% filter(pred_prob  < 0.1) %>% nrow())

(nymph_pred %>% filter(nymph_presence==1, pred_prob  < 0.25) %>% nrow())/(nymph_pred %>% filter(pred_prob  < 0.25) %>% nrow())
```
Of the samples where the model predicted < 0.05 chance of ticks, 3.6 percent had ticks (4 percent error).
Of the samples where the model predicted < 0.10 chance of ticks, 4.1 percent had ticks.
Of the samples where the model predicted < 0.25 chance of ticks, 11 percent had ticks.

Were there plots where model predicts very high chance of ticks, but they were NOT observed?
```{r}
(nymph_pred %>% filter(nymph_presence==0, pred_prob  > 0.6) %>% nrow())/(nymph_pred %>% filter(pred_prob  > 0.6) %>% nrow())
```

Of the samples where model predicted > 0.6 chance of ticks, 17 percent did NOT have ticks.

Overall, how well does predicted probablity of presence match observed presence?

```{r}
nymph_pred %>% ggplot(aes(x = pred_prob, y = nymph_presence)) + geom_jitter(width = .001, height = 0.05, alpha = .3, size = 3, col = "forestgreen") +
  xlab("Model predicted probability of presence")+
  ylab("Observed tick presence") +
  theme_classic()
```

Using a confusion matrix to evaluate how well the model predicts presence/absence:

```{r}
confusionMatrix(data = as.factor(as.numeric(nymph_pred$pred_prob>0.5)),
                      reference = as.factor(nymph_pred$nymph_presence))
```

Model seems fairly decent at predicting presence absence! 

### How well does the model do at predicting abundance?

Compare the predicted count from the model to the observed count:

```{r}
nymph_pred %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=estimatedCount, y= pred_mean_count))+
  geom_point(alpha = .5, size = 3, col = "magenta")+
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, col ="magenta")+
  theme_classic()+
  ylab("Predicted count from model")+
  xlab("Observed count")
```

Yikes. They seem to correlate, but the model is consistently predicting a higher count than observed (e.g. our model is biased).

Let's figure out why. First, extract the records that have bad predictions:
```{r}
nymph_pred$resid <- nymph_pred$estimatedCount - nymph_pred$pred_mean_count
mean(nymph_pred$resid) # negative, meaning we are OVER predicting
hist(nymph_pred$resid)
# the "really bad" resids are < -25
nymph_pred %>% filter(resid < -25) -> bad_preds
```

For the plots in the "bad" dataset, plot the time series for 2018 only. Predictions are in blue, actuals are in red:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
abun %>% filter(yearPlot %in% bad_preds$yearPlot) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sDayofYear, y = estimatedCount, color = "training")) +
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~plotID) +
  geom_point(data = bad_preds, aes(x=sDayofYear, y = estimatedCount, color = "observed"))+
  geom_point(data = bad_preds, aes(x=sDayofYear, y = pred_mean_count, color = "predicted"))+
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6), axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6),
         strip.background = element_blank(), axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
         strip.text = element_blank())+
   xlab("Day of Year (scaled)")+
   ylab("Nymph count")+
   scale_color_manual(values = c("dodgerblue", "coral", "black"))
```

What about the predictions that aren't as bad? Anything different about those time series?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
nymph_pred %>% filter(resid>-15 & resid < 15) -> good_preds
abun %>% filter(yearPlot %in% good_preds$yearPlot) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sDayofYear, y = estimatedCount, color = "training")) +
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~plotID) +
  geom_point(data = good_preds, aes(x=sDayofYear, y = estimatedCount, color = "observed"))+
  geom_point(data = good_preds, aes(x=sDayofYear, y = pred_mean_count, color = "predicted"))+
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6), axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6),
         strip.background = element_blank(), axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
         strip.text = element_blank())+
   xlab("Day of Year (scaled)")+
   ylab("Nymph count")+
   scale_color_manual(values = c("dodgerblue", "coral", "black"))

```

A lot of these are zeros -- the plot pretty much always has zero ticks and so the prediction matches well.

Why the bias towards high nymph counts? Is 2018 weird? Combine the training and testing datasets and visualize yearly patterns in nymphal density. 

```{r}
nymph_all <- rbind(abun, nymphtest)

nymph_all %>% ggplot(aes(x=sDayofYear, y = log(density+.1), group = plotID)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = plotID), show.legend=FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
   theme_tick()+
   xlab("Day of Year (scaled)") +
   ylab("log (nymph density)")
```

Yes; 2018 seems like a weird year in terms of low densities, explaining why the model reliably over-predicts. 

In future models, year-level covariates could be useful in making predictions; e.g. perhaps 2018 is a low mammal year or has a climate not favorable for nymph recruitment. 

Plot predictions vs. actuals for plots that sometimes have ticks. Predictions are in blue, actuals are in red.
```{r, echo = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
# take a look at predictions for just those plots that *sometimes* have ticks

abun %>% filter(totalTicks_plot>0) %>% pull(plotID) %>% unique() %>% as.character() ->  positive.plots

abun %>% filter(plotID %in%  positive.plots[1:25], year == 2018, plotID %in% nymph_pred$plotID) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sDayofYear, y = estimatedCount)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = "training"))+
  geom_point(data = filter(nymph_pred, plotID %in% positive.plots[1:25]), aes(x=sDayofYear, y = estimatedCount, color = "observed"))+
  geom_point(data = filter(nymph_pred, plotID %in% positive.plots[1:25]), aes(x=sDayofYear, y = pred_mean_count, color = "predicted"))+
   facet_wrap(~plotID, scales = "free") +
   theme_tick()+
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6), axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6),
         strip.background = element_blank(), axis.title = element_text(size = 12))+
   xlab("Day of Year (scaled)")+
   ylab("Nymph count")+
   scale_color_manual(values = c("dodgerblue", "coral", "black"))

# next 25
abun %>% filter(plotID %in%  positive.plots[26:49], year == 2018, plotID %in% nymph_pred$plotID) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=sDayofYear, y = estimatedCount)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = "training"))+
  geom_point(data = filter(nymph_pred, plotID %in% positive.plots[26:49]), aes(x=sDayofYear, y = estimatedCount, color = "observed"))+
  geom_point(data = filter(nymph_pred, plotID %in% positive.plots[26:49]), aes(x=sDayofYear, y = pred_mean_count, color = "predicted"))+
   facet_wrap(~plotID, scales = "free") +
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6), axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6),
         strip.background = element_blank(), axis.title = element_text(size = 12))+
   xlab("Day of Year (scaled)")+
   ylab("Nymph count")+
   scale_color_manual(values = c("dodgerblue", "coral", "black"))
   
rm(bad_preds, good_preds, plotMeans)

```

## Closing thoughts

Overall, the model does better at presence/absence than abundance. However, the way we did our testing and training dataset matters; our test dataset was subsetted by year. Therefore if abundance (rather than presence/absence) varies strongly across years, then our data won't be as good at predicting abundance.

There is a lot of variation among plots. Right now, this is a random effect and if we had previous years of data, we were fairly good at predicting presence/absence at a plot in the next year. But what if we wanted to predict entirely new plots? Right now, the only informative covariates are day of year and nlcd. The uncertainty on the nlcd classes is large. Therefore, if we want to predict what will happen at NEW plots, we need a lot more plot-level and year-level information. This would be useful not only in predictions, but also in understanding mechanism; right now we know very little about why some plots have high tick densities. 

Future models could incorporate small mammal density, litter, and other plot-year level information to make predictions. T
